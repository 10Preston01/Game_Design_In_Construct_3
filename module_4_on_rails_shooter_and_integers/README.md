# Integers, Random Integers, & Their Use in Game Design
This tutorial will step you through working with integers, and random integers, in the context of a Z axis "on rails" shooter, similar to those that you see in arcades. Take a look at the finished .c3p file before getting started, to see what you'll be making. 

## By the end of this tutorial you should know:
1. What an *Integer* or *Int* variable is
2. How to use math operators (+ - x รท) in a program
3. How to use a "for each" loop to create events that affect a single instance of an object, without affecting ALL instances of that object. 
4. What Z-elevation is, and how to use it to create "depth of field" effects in games

# Tutorial

### In this tutorial, you'll be using a pre-made game as a base and building on top of it.  In the construct editor, please open the corresponding module's construct folder. 

**Note**
- All yellow code-groups you will not need to edit. They provide base functionality, and are not necessary to modify. 

## 1. Spawn an asteroid sprite on the ship layer every random seconds 

##### The Random Method

- accepts arguments as integers (0,-5,32, etc) and floats (or a "floating" number) (0.12, -3.4932) 

1. in the main event sheet under the "Asteroid Extension Group", every few seconds **Create object** asteroid sprite at a random location inside the viewport/layout size (320x180). This will spawn an asteroid somewhere on the layout. 
 - *Hint*: you'll also want to make sure the ship is capable of colliding with the asteroid, so you'll need to "clamp" (constrain) the asteroid to smaller than this margin. (*For Example, if the width of our layout is 320, create the X location randomly between 0+margin of error, and 320-margin of error*) If the ship is not capable of moving all they way to the edge of the layout, 320, spawning an asteroid here makes no sense. You may need to play with this 320-margine of error section as you play. 
2. Set the instance variable of the asteroid, "speed" (*integer*,) to a random number range. Run the program to test how fast it runs. Adjust speed as needed.   
3. Set the Z elevation of the asteroid to spawn "out in the distance" at the bottom of our main layour at a -100 Z elevation. 

## 2. Make the ship register a collision with an asteroid
1. Add in a collision event for the ship and the asteroid in a "For Each Asteroid" loop. (System > Loops > for each) (Similar to the "bullets" in the target code group).

2. Make a "on collision with asteroid" sub-event with 2 conditions. (This will then do all of the following **for each** asteroid, rather than treating *all* asteroids as a single sprite.) 

    -Is Asteroid overlapping Ship

    -System: value Is between 2 values. 
     - The value of the ship's Z elevation
     - is between: the +/- z elevation of the asteroid (with a range +/- the asteroid_collision_margin)

## 3. Destroy the ship on enough contacts with asteroids. 
1. On collision, subtract 1 from the ship's *instance variable* "health" 
2. Set the ship's animation to play "collision" from the beginning. 
3. Similar to the ghost shooter, add in an event that if the ship's health < than 0, it should be destroyed. 

Test out your game, can you make your ship hit and blow up asteroids? 

# Extension Ideas
- Add a health instance variable to the asteroids, and make the "bullet" object destroy them?
*Hint*- Take a look at the "Target" code group, "For each bullet", see if you can mirror this in your own code. 
- Make the asteroid create an object "Big explosion" explode on impact
- Add a new text object to the HUD, and make it display the ship's health (you may need to use  ("Append" +  str(instance variable)) to turn the integer  variable into a string variable to be able to be displayed 
- Add a different kind of enemy to randomly spawn like the asteroid.
