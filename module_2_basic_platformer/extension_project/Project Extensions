# Project Extension ideas

- add a "health" or "lives" instance variable to the player
- make the player's animation change to "bounce" after jumping off of an enemy
- make a "game over" screen
- change how the playerbox platform "jump" parameters interact, adding in double jump, etc. 
- edit the levels "tilemap" to create more enemys, more platforms, or environmental hazards like lava or poison pits
