# Game Design In Construct 3
 
 This repository takes construct 3 tutorials available from www.construct.net (that use CC licenses) modifies, restructures, comments project code to be easier to read and better in line with a High School game design course. This repository requires a paid construct 3 license. 

# How to use this Repository

The Module folders that are intended to be completed in sequential order. Inside each module:
1. Download the game_assets folder
3. Begin with the "intial project tutorial". Open the initial .c3p file in construct 3, and play through the game to see the finished project. 
4. Create a new, blank construct 3 project. 
5. Open the www.construct.net tutorial and follow through the steps in your new project.
6. When the tutorial is complete, open the "extension_project" folder and test the extension .c3p project. How might you extend functionality in your intial game? Use these suggested extensions as starting points for what to change in your own project. 

# Repository Structure

Each Module folder includes:
1. the intial tutorial project 
- a hyperlink to the original construct3 tutorial on www.construct.net
- a .c3p file for testing the final project created

2. game_assets
- all initial assets used (does not include extension project assets) 

3. extension_project
